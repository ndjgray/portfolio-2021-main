      <div class="education_text">
		    <p>Upon graduating from Chicago's Lindblom Math and Science Academy in 2017, I continued my education at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After being directly admitted to the College of Engineering (CoE), I decided to pursue Industrial and Operations Engineering (IOE). During my time in the CoE, I had the opportunity to work on various design projects with local Ann Arbor companies; the most notable project involved designing a flour silo and transportation system for Zingerman's Bakehouse. However, after two years into the program, my love for engineering began to fizzle out, but I knew I still wanted to pursue STEM. </p>

      <div class="education_text">
        <p>My lack of interest in engineering led me to start taking classes at the University of Michigan's School of Information. Through my courses in the School of Information, I got to work on projects at the intersection of people, technology, and information, the most notable being data analysis on the spread of COVID-19 and population density. At the end of my junior year, I decided to take a late leap of faith and applied to the University of Michigan School of Information. Despite pushing my graduation year from 2021 to 2022, accepting my admissions offer to the School of Information has been extremely rewarding. I currently hold extensive knowledge of HTML and CSS, certifications in introductory data science with python, applied machine learning in python, and a deep learning specialization.</p>
