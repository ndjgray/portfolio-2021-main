            <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always had a job. Throughout elementary school, I worked as an entrepreneur by starting a pencil and nameplate customization business. As I got older and enrolled in high school, I used these same entrepreneurial skills to run a snack shop for students right out of my backpack. In my sophomore year in high school, I decided to leave my entrepreneurial background behind. I joined the Chicago Summer Business Institute and began working for corporations. My first corporate job was an internship with Chicago's City Hall Department of Finance Account Receivable Cost Recovery Division. Throughout this internship, I conducted many debt clearances and payment plan implementation for citizens.</p>

            <p>I landed my next serious internship in 2016 with Maestros Ventures Engineering Firm located in Chicago. Throughout this internship, I explored and evaluated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning engineering design under CEO Michael Gonzalez to build system designs for construction projects in the Chicago Metropolitan area. That internship significantly contributed to my initial decision to study engineering at the University of Michigan. </p>

            <p>One year after living like a broke college student at the University of Michigan, I decided that I no longer wanted to beg my parents for money. My stellar customer service skills and extensive knowledge of the University's campus landed me a job at the University's Campus Information Center from 2018-2020. </p>

            <p>At the University of Michigan's Engineering Career Fair in 2019, I met my next corporate employer, Procter and Gamble. I completed two summer internships with Procter and Gamble in 2019 and 2020. I executed project management on a virtual reality application and planogram asset creation.
                Based on my performance throughout my internships at P&G, I received an internship offer for the 2020 - 2021 academic year with one of P&G's contracting companies, Kaleidoscope Innovation. I currently work as an IT project manager on various innovation center web and mobile applications. </p>
